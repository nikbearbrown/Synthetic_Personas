# Synthetic Survey Respondents Creator
OpenAI GPT that creates synthetic 'personalities' based on demographics and other info provided. 

## Project Goal
The goal is to have a convenient method that survey methodologists and researchers can use to test survey response questions. Improved questions lead to better quality resonses. This testing tool isn't intended to replace humans in the field testing of questions, but to help make it faster and easier with less testing, cost, and other resources involved with survey preparation. 

A future project is the GPT that will use these to provide survey responses. However, the personality file could simple be uploaded as a reference to any LLM of your choice capabile of using it to adjust/tune responses with that synthetic persona. 

## Prompt Template
The [Prompt Tempate](https://github.com/brockwebb/Respondent-Personality-Synth/blob/main/persona-generator-prompt-csv.md) in this project can be cut & pasted into the GPT and modified according to your needs. 

## Usage
- The GPT is available on the OpenAI GPT Store: [Respondent Personality Synth](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-oLZoAz20f-respondent-personality-synth)
- The above prompt tempate is recommended for best results.

## Interesting reads and summaries
- [Synthetic Users](https://www.syntheticusers.com/) specializes in synth respondants for survey work. It says it uses multiple AI agents to get a better/blended response. Cost per year for large enterprises doesn't seem bad.
- [Synthetic Users: If, When, and How to Use AI-Generated “Research”](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/synthetic-users/) (June 24, 2024). Great article that discusses why, but also limitations of synth users. Short read and very understandable, great reference/read. 
- [How to Build Your Own AI Chatbot in 2024: The Ultimate Guide](https://botpress.com/blog/how-to-build-your-own-ai-chatbot) (Jan 12, 2024). Synth users are different from 'chatbots' but it's good to know a little about them and this is a great reference. Chatbots are more specialized and task specific, even if it's a similar idea of 'chatting' with an AI. Massive amounts of past survey data for peridoic surveys from help desk calls could be fed into training a bot, but for the help of answering simple questions for respondants (complex things most likely still require a human for now) ... or creating a few 'specialized' limited number personality bots for training new survey takers based on historical responsed for certain groups.
- [A Survey of Personality, Persona, and Profile in Conversational Agents and Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.00609v1) (Dec 31, 2023). The paper reviews how personality traits are added to chatbots, detailing the methods and datasets used. It highlights different personality schemes, training data, and techniques for making chatbots feel more personalized. The study showcases current progress and suggests areas for future research... more is needed.
- [Creating Synthetic User Research: Using Persona Prompting and Autonomous Agents](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-synthetic-user-research-using-persona-prompting-and-autonomous-agents-b521e0a80ab6) (March 25, 2024). The article explains how synthetic user research uses autonomous agents and persona prompting to simulate customer interactions and gather insights. By creating digital personas with detailed backgrounds and behaviors, researchers can explore consumer preferences and pain points in a controlled, realistic setting. This innovative method enhances traditional research by providing a scalable and efficient way to understand diverse customer groups and their needs​.
- [5 Ways to Use AI to Improve Your Survey Research](https://www.insightplatforms.com/5-ways-to-use-ai-to-improve-your-survey-research/) -- Has links to lots of AI tools and discusses methods at different stages of a survey lifycycle. Nice that it has specificity on each of the five ways with AI tools to do the job needed.
- [Top 13 AI Survey Tools For Smart Feedback Collection](https://www.zonkafeedback.com/blog/ai-survey-tools) (Jul 29, 2024). Quick overview of many popular "AI" powered survey instruments. Worth a glance to see what's available on the market and what they do.
