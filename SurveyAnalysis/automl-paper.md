## Abstract

This paper presents a novel automated machine learning (AutoML) framework specifically designed for market research applications, focusing on survey data analysis. The system integrates dimensional reduction techniques, market segmentation, and preference modeling within an automated pipeline that requires minimal human intervention. Our approach combines factor analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and clustering algorithms with automated hyperparameter tuning and model selection to extract actionable insights from complex survey datasets. The framework autonomously identifies underlying consumer dimensions, detects natural market segments, and establishes relationships between consumer attributes and product preferences. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through extensive validation on both synthetic and real-world survey datasets across multiple industries. The results indicate that our AutoML approach achieves comparable or superior performance to manual analysis by expert market researchers while reducing analysis time from days to minutes. Furthermore, the system provides automatic interpretation of results in natural language, making sophisticated statistical analyses accessible to marketing professionals without specialized statistical expertise. This research advances the field of computational market research by democratizing access to advanced analytical techniques and accelerating the insight generation process.

## 1. Introduction

Market research has long relied on statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights from survey data, with dimensional reduction methods like factor analysis and segmentation approaches such as cluster analysis forming the cornerstone of modern quantitative market research. Traditionally, these analyses require significant expertise in statistical methodology and are often time-consuming, creating barriers to their widespread application. Moreover, the quality of insights derived from such analyses heavily depends on the analyst's experience and domain knowledge.

The rise of automated machine learning (AutoML) has transformed various domains by automating the process of algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. However, existing AutoML frameworks primarily target predictive modeling tasks and are not tailored to the unique requirements of market research, which often involves exploratory analysis, dimensional reduction, and segment discovery rather than pure prediction.

This research addresses this gap by developing a specialized AutoML framework for market research applications. Our system automates the entire workflow from data preprocessing to insight generation, covering key analytical approaches including factor analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and regression modeling. The framework incorporates domain-specific knowledge about market research methodologies and incorporates automatic interpretation capabilities to translate statistical outputs into actionable marketing insights.

The key contributions of this paper include:

1. A comprehensive AutoML pipeline specifically designed for market research survey analysis
2. Novel algorithms for automated selection between factor analysis and PCA based on interpretability metrics
3. An integrated approach to determining optimal numbers of factors and clusters
4. Automated interpretation of statistical outputs into marketing implications
5. Validation of the system on diverse real-world market research datasets

By automating the analytical process, our framework aims to democratize access to sophisticated market research techniques, reduce the time and cost associated with survey analysis, and help organizations make data-driven marketing decisions more efficiently.

### 2.1 AutoML Systems

Automated Machine Learning has seen significant development in recent years. Systems such as Auto-WEKA (Thornton et al., 2013), Auto-sklearn (Feurer et al., 2015), and H2O AutoML (LeDell & Poirier, 2020) have demonstrated the viability of automating the machine learning pipeline for supervised learning tasks. These systems focus primarily on algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, and ensemble creation for classification and regression problems.

More recent developments include TPOT (Olson et al., 2016), which uses genetic programming to optimize machine learning pipelines, and AutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2020), which emphasizes ease of use and robustness. While these systems have advanced the field of AutoML, they are primarily designed for predictive modeling rather than the exploratory and dimensional reduction tasks common in market research.

### 2.2 Dimensional Reduction Techniques in Market Research

Factor analysis and PCA have been extensively used in market research to identify underlying dimensions in consumer preferences and attitudes. Thompson (2004) provides a comprehensive overview of factor analysis and its applications in social sciences, while Abdi and Williams (2010) detail the applications of PCA in various domains including market research.

Studies by Hair et al. (2019) have established methodological guidelines for applying these techniques in market research contexts, emphasizing the importance of rotation methods in factor analysis for improving interpretability. Recent work by Dolnicar and Gr√ºn (2017) has highlighted challenges in the application of these methods, particularly regarding subjective decisions in determining the number of factors to extract.

### 2.3 Market Segmentation Approaches

Market segmentation through cluster analysis has been a fundamental approach in marketing research for decades. Wedel and Kamakura (2000) provide a seminal overview of market segmentation methods, while more recent work by Dolnicar et al. (2018) explores modern approaches to segmentation, including model-based clustering.

Automated approaches to market segmentation have been explored by Cheung et al. (2019), who developed algorithms for automatically determining the optimal number of segments. However, these approaches have not been fully integrated with dimensional reduction techniques in an end-to-end automated system.

### 2.4 Interpretation of Statistical Results

The interpretation of statistical outputs into actionable insights remains a challenge in market research. Ernst and Dolnicar (2018) highlight the importance of translating statistical results into managerially relevant insights. Recent advances in natural language generation (Gatt & Krahmer, 2018) have created opportunities for automated interpretation of statistical results, though applications in market research remain limited.

Our work builds upon these foundations by creating an integrated system that not only automates the technical aspects of market research analysis but also addresses the crucial step of translating statistical findings into actionable marketing insights.

#### 3.2.2 Missing Data Handling

The system employs a decision tree to select appropriate missing data handling techniques:

1. If missing data < 5% and Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) test is non-significant: Simple imputation with mean/mode
2. If missing data < 10% and Missing At Random (MAR): Multiple imputation using chained equations
3. If missing data > 10% or Missing Not At Random (MNAR): Flag to user for manual intervention

The MCAR test is implemented using Little's test (Little, 1988), while MAR is assessed through correlation analysis between missingness patterns and observed variables.

#### 3.2.3 Outlier Detection and Treatment

For outlier detection, the system uses a combination of:

1. Univariate detection: Z-scores, modified Z-scores with median absolute deviation (MAD)
2. Multivariate detection: Mahalanobis distance and isolation forest

Outlier treatment follows these rules:
- For Likert-scale data: No transformation applied
- For continuous variables: Winsorization at the 5th and 95th percentiles
- For highly skewed variables: Log or Box-Cox transformation

#### 3.2.4 Likert Scale and Ordinal Variable Handling

The system implements a sophisticated dual-analysis approach for Likert-type variables:
