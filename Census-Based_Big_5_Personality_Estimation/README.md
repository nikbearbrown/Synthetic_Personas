# Census-Based Big 5 Personality Estimation
## Project Abstract

This project aims to develop a predictive model that generates synthetic estimates of Big 5 personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) based on demographic variables available in public census data. By leveraging established correlations between demographic factors and personality traits, we will create a tool that can estimate personality distributions across geographic regions and demographic segments. These synthetic personality estimates will enable novel applications in market research, public health planning, and social science research without requiring direct personality assessment of populations.

The model will be trained on existing datasets that contain both demographic information and Big 5 personality measurements, then applied to census data to generate area-level personality estimates. This approach acknowledges the probabilistic nature of these estimates while providing valuable insights into potential personality distributions across populations where direct measurement is impractical.

## Requirements Document

### 1. Project Objectives

  - Big 5 personality measurements using validated instruments (NEO-PI-R, BFI, or equivalent)
  - Demographic variables that overlap with census categories
  - Sufficient diversity in age, gender, geography, and socioeconomic status
- Potential sources: IPIP-NEO open datasets, academic research repositories, or commercial partnerships

#### 2.2 Census Data

  - Age distributions
  - Gender
  - Education levels
  - Income brackets
  - Occupation categories
