# BrandEcho: An Open-Source Framework for Analyzing Brand Perception Across Large Language Models

## Abstract

As artificial intelligence increasingly mediates consumer purchasing decisions, understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perceive and represent brands becomes critical for businesses of all sizes. This paper introduces BrandEcho, an open-source framework designed to analyze brand perception across multiple LLMs. Unlike proprietary solutions with prohibitive costs, BrandEcho democratizes access to AI perception analytics, enabling smaller businesses and researchers to understand their algorithmic representation. We present the system architecture, methodological approach, and implementation details of BrandEcho, including its query generation engine, multi-model integration layer, response analysis frameworks, and visualization components. While results from deployment remain to be determined, this paper provides comprehensive documentation to enable immediate implementation and community-driven enhancement. BrandEcho represents a significant step toward transparency and accessibility in the emerging field of algorithmic brand perception.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as intermediaries in consumer decision-making represents a fundamental shift in the marketing landscape. When consumers ask AI systems for product recommendations, the way these models perceive and represent brands directly impacts purchasing decisions. Recent studies estimate that 28% of consumers already use AI to recommend products (Mulligan, 2025), with projections suggesting this figure could reach 50% by 2026 (Johnson & Moore, 2024).

Proprietary tools have emerged to help businesses understand their AI representation, but these solutions typically target enterprise clients with substantial resources. Small and medium-sized businesses, academic researchers, and non-profit organizations frequently lack access to these insights due to prohibitive costs, creating an "AI perception gap" that may exacerbate existing market inequalities.

This paper introduces BrandEcho, an open-source framework designed to democratize access to AI brand perception analytics. By providing a comprehensive, adaptable, and freely available toolset, BrandEcho enables entities of all sizes to systematically analyze their representation across multiple LLMs. The system facilitates understanding of how different models perceive brand attributes, product features, competitive positioning, and recommendation patterns.

The contributions of this paper include:

1. A detailed architectural blueprint for BrandEcho, including component specifications and interaction patterns
2. A systematic methodology for query generation, model interaction, and response analysis
3. Implementation details including code structures, API integration approaches, and data processing pipelines
4. Discussion of ethical considerations and bias mitigation strategies
5. Documentation for extension and community contribution

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Commercial AI Perception Tools

Several commercial platforms have emerged to address brand perception in AI systems. Jellyfish's "Share of Model" analyzes brand representation across LLMs using a survey-like methodology (Mulligan, 2025). Similar proprietary solutions include BrandAI Monitor (Technometrics, 2024) and AIPerceive (MarketSense, 2023). These platforms generally employ black-box methodologies and carry subscription costs ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 monthly (Klein & Thompson, 2024), limiting their accessibility.

### 2.2 Academic Research on AI Brand Perception

Research by Chen et al. (2024) demonstrated significant variance in how different LLMs represent identical brands, with perception divergence of 27-41% across key dimensions including quality assessment and brand personality. Kamruzzaman and colleagues (2023) identified systematic bias favoring global brands over local alternatives, raising equity concerns. Lin et al. (2024) documented the "prompt effect" phenomenon, where minor wording variations in queries can dramatically alter recommendation patterns.

### 2.3 Open-Source AI Analysis Tools

Existing open-source tools address related but distinct problems. LLM-Eval (Zheng et al., 2023) focuses on general model performance rather than brand perception. AIBiasCheck (Rodriguez & Kim, 2024) examines bias patterns but lacks marketing-specific functionality. OpenPrompt (Taylor et al., 2023) provides prompt engineering capabilities but doesn't include comparative analysis across models or domain-specific query generation.

BrandEcho builds upon these precedents while addressing the specific requirements of brand perception analysis across multiple LLMs in an accessible, transparent framework.

## 3. System Architecture

BrandEcho employs a modular architecture designed for extensibility, reproducibility, and ease of deployment. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level system architecture, comprising five primary components: the Query Generator, Model Interface Layer, Response Analyzer, Insight Engine, and Visualization Module.

### 3.1 Query Generator

The Query Generator creates structured prompts designed to elicit model representations of brand attributes. It comprises:

- **Topic Taxonomy Manager**: Maintains hierarchical classification of query topics (brand attributes, product features, competitive comparisons, recommendation scenarios)
- **Linguistic Variation Engine**: Generates multiple phrasings for equivalent queries to control for wording effects
- **Audience Perspective Module**: Creates queries from different demographic and psychographic perspectives

## 4. Methods

### 4.1 Query Design Methodology

BrandEcho employs a systematic approach to query construction that balances comprehensiveness with computational efficiency.

#### 4.1.1 Base Query Templates

We developed a standardized set of query templates covering five core dimensions of brand perception:

1. **Brand Awareness**: "Are you familiar with [BRAND]?" / "What can you tell me about [BRAND]?"
2. **Brand Attributes**: "How would you describe [BRAND]?" / "What are the main characteristics of [BRAND]?"
3. **Product Features**: "What features does [PRODUCT] by [BRAND] have?" / "Can you describe [PRODUCT] by [BRAND]?"
4. **Competitive Comparison**: "How does [BRAND] compare to [COMPETITOR]?" / "What are the differences between [BRAND] and [COMPETITOR]?"
5. **Recommendation Scenarios**: "Can you recommend a [PRODUCT_CATEGORY] for [USE_CASE]?" / "What's the best [PRODUCT_CATEGORY] for [SITUATION]?"

#### 4.1.2 Linguistic Variation Generation

To control for the "prompt effect" documented by Lin et al. (2024), each base query is expanded into multiple linguistic variations that preserve semantic intent while varying syntax, vocabulary, and framing. This is accomplished through:

- **Synonym Substitution**: Replacing key terms with semantically equivalent alternatives
- **Syntactic Transformation**: Restructuring sentence patterns while preserving meaning
- **Perspective Shifting**: Reframing queries from different viewpoints (e.g., "Tell me about X" vs. "What would consumers say about X")
- **Specificity Variation**: Adjusting the level of detail and constraint in the query

#### 4.1.3 Audience Perspective Incorporation

To assess potential variation in brand representation across audience segments, queries are further modified to simulate different user perspectives:

- **Demographic Contexts**: Age, gender, location, income level
- **Use Cases**: Professional, casual, specialized applications
- **Value Priorities**: Price sensitivity, quality focus, ethics emphasis
- **Knowledge Levels**: Expert, novice, moderately informed

#### 4.1.4 Query Validation Process

Before deployment, generated queries undergo validation to ensure:

- **Neutrality**: Minimizing leading questions that might bias responses
- **Clarity**: Ensuring unambiguous interpretation by models
- **Consistency**: Maintaining comparable structure across variations
- **Coverage**: Addressing all relevant perception dimensions
