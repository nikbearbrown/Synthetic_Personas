## 1. Introduction

The service industry is increasingly embracing artificial intelligence to enhance customer experiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude are frequently consulted by consumers seeking recommendations for restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and entertainment venues (Chen & Rodriguez, 2024). However, this trend presents a significant challenge for service businesses: they have minimal control over how they are represented in these systems, which may favor competitors or misrepresent their offerings (Martinez et al., 2023).

Simultaneously, service businesses struggle to gather comprehensive customer feedback. Traditional methods such as surveys suffer from low response rates, self-reporting bias, and demographic mismatches between respondents and the actual customer base (Williams & Taylor, 2024). This creates a critical information gap regarding customers' preferences, behaviors, and decision drivers.

Proprietary AI concierge solutions have emerged to address these challenges, but they typically require substantial financial investment and technical expertise, placing them beyond the reach of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). There exists a clear need for accessible, customizable AI concierge systems that can be deployed by service businesses with limited resources.

This paper introduces OpenConcierge, an open-source framework designed to democratize access to AI concierge technology. The system serves dual purposes:

1. **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Providing personalized recommendations, educational information, and guidance tailored to a business's specific offerings
2. **Intelligent Data Collection:** Gathering rich insights on customer preferences, behaviors, and decision factors during natural interactions

The contributions of this paper include:

1. A comprehensive architectural framework for building customizable AI concierge systems
2. A methodological approach for knowledge base construction, conversation design, and recommendation algorithms
3. Implementation guidelines for privacy-preserving data collection and analysis
4. Tools and templates to facilitate adoption by businesses with limited technical resources

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Commercial AI Concierge Systems

Several commercial platforms offer AI concierge capabilities for service businesses. HospitalityGPT provides specialized solutions for hotels and restaurants (Johnson, 2024), while RetailAssist offers AI-powered shopping assistants for retail environments (Chen et al., 2023). These solutions typically leverage proprietary LLMs with domain-specific training and command subscription fees ranging from $500 to $5,000 monthly, placing them beyond the reach of many SMBs.

### 2.2 Personalized Recommendation Systems

Extensive research exists on recommendation algorithms for service contexts. Collaborative filtering approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in restaurant and product recommendations (Gonzalez & Smith, 2023), while content-based filtering has shown promise for experience-based services (Rodriguez et al., 2024). Hybrid approaches combining multiple recommendation strategies consistently outperform single-method implementations (Patel & Wong, 2024).

### 2.3 Interactive Data Collection

Novel approaches to customer feedback collection have emerged, moving beyond traditional surveys. Conversational interfaces have demonstrated 3-5x higher engagement rates compared to standard questionnaires (Taylor et al., 2023). Contextual inquiry methods embedded within service interactions yield richer, more relevant data than retrospective feedback mechanisms (Williams & Johnson, 2024).

Recent research by Chen and Davidson (2024) demonstrates the effectiveness of evolutionary survey approaches that begin with structured questions but seamlessly transition into natural conversations. This hybrid methodology maintains the statistical rigor of traditional surveys while capturing the contextual richness of open dialogue. Their findings indicate that participants provide 42% more detailed information and express 37% higher satisfaction with the interaction compared to either traditional surveys or fully unstructured conversations.

Lopez et al. (2023) further illustrate how integrating survey elements within conversational systems can create a "progressive disclosure" effect, where initial responses guide subsequent inquiry paths without the rigidity of predetermined question sequences. Their longitudinal study involving 1,200 restaurant patrons found that this approach not only increased completion rates by 68% but also uncovered decision factors that customers themselves had not explicitly recognized in traditional feedback formats.

Particularly promising is the work of Ramachandran and Williams (2024), who demonstrated successful implementations of "stealth feedback" systems where customers engage with what they perceive as helpful service interactions while the system simultaneously gathers structured intelligence. Their framework for embedding research methodologies within service conversations provides valuable templates for ethical data collection that benefits both businesses and customers simultaneously.

### 2.4 Open-Source AI Solutions

While open-source projects exist for general conversational agents (e.g., Rasa, Botpress) and recommendation systems (e.g., LensKit, Surprise), few specifically address the dual needs of customer experience enhancement and business intelligence in service contexts. OpenFoodRecommend (Martinez & Lee, 2023) offers specialized capabilities for restaurants but lacks broader applicability across service industries and does not incorporate business intelligence features.

OpenConcierge builds upon these precedents while addressing the specific requirements of service businesses seeking both customer experience enhancement and actionable intelligence through a single, affordable, and customizable platform.

## 3. System Architecture

OpenConcierge employs a modular architecture designed for extensibility, customization, and ease of deployment across diverse service contexts. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level system architecture, comprising six primary components that work together to deliver personalized customer interactions while gathering valuable business intelligence.
