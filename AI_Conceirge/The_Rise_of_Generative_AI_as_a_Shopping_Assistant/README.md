- Consumer familiarity with product category taxonomy was strongly correlated with AI success
- Products requiring sensory evaluation (touch, try-on, scent) showed lowest AI effectiveness
- Prior purchase experience in a category increased AI recommendation acceptance by 142%

**Boston Consulting Group's Consumer Decision Journey Analysis** identified specific purchase journey factors that predict AI effectiveness:
- High information asymmetry (expert vs. consumer knowledge gap) predicted strong AI benefit
- High decision complexity (many features to compare) showed 2.3x AI benefit
- High purchase risk (expensive items) showed 1.9x AI benefit
- High emotional investment showed 0.7x AI benefit (negative correlation)

These findings collectively suggest that the variation in AI effectiveness across categories reflects fundamental differences in how consumers make decisions in these categories. Products with specific technical specifications, objective comparison points, complex feature sets, and higher price points (such as electronics) appear to benefit most from AI assistance. Conversely, products with strong subjective, sensory, or emotional components show lower AI impact.
