# US Adult Literacy Levels

The following data is based on the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which assesses adult skills on a scale of 0-500, divided into six levels: Below Level 1, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5.

For simplicity, we'll present the percentage of adults at each level:
