##OCEAN PERSONALITY DATASET FOR SELECTED DEMOGRAPHICS
A comprehensive dataset with all the available data for the OCEAN personality model, including sources. 

###DESCRIPTION
Here's a breakdown of what's included:

1. Sources: The first row of the CSV contains the source information for the data, as requested.

2. Column Headers: The second row contains the headers for each column of data.

3. Data Columns:
   - Trait: The Big Five personality trait (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
   - Demographic: The demographic category (Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education)
   - Category: Specific subcategories within each demographic
   - Mean: Average score for each trait-demographic combination
   - SD: Standard deviation
   - Range_Min: Minimum observed score
   - Range_Max: Maximum observed score
   - Skew: Measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution
   - Kurtosis: Measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution
   - Cronbach_Alpha: A measure of internal consistency (reliability)
   - Test_Retest_Reliability: Correlation between test scores when the test is repeated

4. Data Rows: Each row represents a specific combination of trait and demographic category, providing a detailed breakdown of the OCEAN model across various population segments.

5. Overall Statistics: For each trait, there's an "Overall" row that provides general population statistics.

This CSV format allows for easy import into various data analysis tools and spreadsheet applications. It provides a comprehensive view of the OCEAN personality model data, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape.


###NOTES:
Some key points to remember when working with this data:

1. The data is based on large-scale studies and meta-analyses, but individual studies might show some variations.

2. Cultural context can significantly influence personality trait expression, so these patterns might not hold true across all cultural settings.

3. While the data shows clear trends, there's significant individual variation within each category.

4. The reliability measures (Cronbach's Alpha and Test-Retest Reliability) are only provided for overall traits, not for specific demographic categories.
