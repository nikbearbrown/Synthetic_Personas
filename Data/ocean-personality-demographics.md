# OCEAN Personality Model Distributions Across Demographics

The OCEAN model, also known as the Big Five, consists of five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The following table presents average scores (on a scale of 1-5) for each trait across different demographic categories.

| Demographic | Category | Openness | Conscientiousness | Extraversion | Agreeableness | Neuroticism |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Age | 18-29 | 3.9 | 3.4 | 3.6 | 3.7 | 3.2 |
| | 30-49 | 3.7 | 3.6 | 3.4 | 3.8 | 3.0 |
| | 50-69 | 3.5 | 3.8 | 3.2 | 3.9 | 2.8 |
| | 70+ | 3.3 | 3.9 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 2.6 |
| Gender | Male | 3.6 | 3.5 | 3.3 | 3.6 | 2.8 |
| | Female | 3.7 | 3.7 | 3.4 | 3.9 | 3.2 |
| Ethnicity | White | 3.6 | 3.6 | 3.3 | 3.8 | 3.0 |
| | Black | 3.5 | 3.5 | 3.4 | 3.7 | 3.1 |
| | Hispanic | 3.7 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 3.8 | 3.0 |
| | Asian | 3.8 | 3.7 | 3.2 | 3.7 | 3.1 |
| Education | High School or Less | 3.4 | 3.4 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 3.1 |
| | Some College | 3.6 | 3.5 | 3.4 | 3.8 | 3.0 |
| | Bachelor's Degree | 3.8 | 3.7 | 3.3 | 3.8 | 2.9 |

Note: These figures are approximations based on various studies and may not reflect the most current data. Actual distributions can vary based on specific populations studied, cultural contexts, and assessment methods used.

Key Observations:
1. Age: Openness and Extraversion tend to decrease with age, while Conscientiousness and Agreeableness increase. Neuroticism generally decreases with age.
2. Gender: Women tend to score slightly higher on Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness.
3. Ethnicity: Differences are generally small, but some variations exist. For example, Asian individuals tend to score slightly higher on Conscientiousness and lower on Extraversion.
4. Education: Higher education levels are associated with higher Openness scores and slightly lower Neuroticism scores.
