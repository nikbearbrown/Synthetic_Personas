Additional Statistical Insights:
1. Distribution Shape: Most traits follow a roughly normal distribution, with some skew:
   - Openness: Slightly negatively skewed (skew ≈ -0.2)
   - Conscientiousness: Approximately normal (skew ≈ 0)
   - Extraversion: Approximately normal (skew ≈ 0)
   - Agreeableness: Moderately negatively skewed (skew ≈ -0.4)
   - Neuroticism: Slightly positively skewed (skew ≈ 0.2)

2. Reliability (Cronbach's alpha):
   - Openness: 0.78
   - Conscientiousness: 0.81
   - Extraversion: 0.86
   - Agreeableness: 0.79
   - Neuroticism: 0.84

3. Test-Retest Reliability (over a 6-month period):
   - Range from 0.73 (Agreeableness) to 0.83 (Extraversion)
