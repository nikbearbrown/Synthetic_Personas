## **Synthetic Personas Projects**

**AI Concierge**  
**Focus:** Open-source framework for personalized AI assistance in service businesses  
**Type:** Technical implementation  
**Key aspects:** Knowledge base management, conversation design, recommendation systems, privacy-preserving data collection  
**Description:** AI Concierge enables service businesses of all sizes to create customized AI assistants that enhance customer experiences while gathering valuable business intelligence. Built with a modular architecture, the system features six core components: a Knowledge Base Manager for storing business-specific information, a Conversation Engine for natural customer interactions, a Recommendation Engine for personalized suggestions, an Intelligence Collector for privacy-preserving data gathering, an Analytics Dashboard for actionable insights, and an Administration Interface designed for non-technical users. Designed to democratize access to technology that has traditionally been proprietary and cost-prohibitive, it can be deployed across various service contexts with flexible implementation options.

**AutoSurvey**  
**Focus:** Automated framework for intelligent survey data analysis  
**Type:** Statistical framework  
**Key aspects:** Variable classification, intelligent statistical selection, assumption verification, automated interpretation  
**Description:** AutoSurvey is an open-source modular framework that automates the survey data analysis process with intelligent statistical selection, functioning as an "AutoML for surveys." The system intelligently processes structured survey data through five integrated components: data preparation, variable classification, analysis selection, visualization generation, and interpretation generation. The framework implements dual-pathway analysis for handling both parametric and non-parametric approaches, properly encodes categorical variables, and provides special handling for Likert-scale data. Built with extensive validation protocols, AutoSurvey makes sophisticated survey analysis accessible while maintaining methodological rigor.

**BrandEcho**  
**Focus:** Open-source framework for analyzing brand perception across LLMs  
**Type:** Technical specification  
**Key aspects:** System architecture, query methodology, multi-model comparison, visualization  
**Description:** A detailed blueprint for an open-source framework that democratizes access to AI brand perception analytics. BrandEcho enables businesses of all sizes to systematically analyze how different large language models perceive and represent their brands through a comprehensive query generation engine, multi-model integration layer, response analysis frameworks, and visualization components. This alternative to expensive proprietary solutions helps businesses understand and potentially influence their algorithmic representation.

**Census-Based Big 5 Personality Estimation**  
**Focus:** Predictive modeling of personality traits from census demographics  
**Type:** Statistical modeling  
**Key aspects:** Big Five personality traits, demographic correlations, geographic estimation, privacy-preserving methods  
**Description:** This project develops a predictive model to generate synthetic estimates of Big 5 personality traits based on demographic variables available in public census data. By leveraging established correlations between demographic factors and personality traits, the system creates area-level personality distribution estimates for geographic regions without requiring direct personality assessment. The framework includes data acquisition pipelines, multiple model architectures, rigorous validation strategies, and interactive visualization tools. With applications in market research, public health planning, and social science research, the system enables novel population-level personality insights.

**MarketMind**  
**Focus:** Open-source framework for AI-driven marketing research  
**Type:** Scientific methodology  
**Key aspects:** Multi-agent system, knowledge acquisition, marketing analysis, implementation  
**Description:** A modular open-source framework leveraging large language models and multi-agent orchestration for sophisticated marketing intelligence tasks. MarketMind employs specialized agents (Research Planner, Analyst, Researcher, Synthesis, and Critique) to conduct competitive analysis, trend identification, brand perception assessment, and opportunity discovery. The system transforms how marketing teams gather and utilize secondary research data through its Knowledge Foundation, Agent Ecosystem, Orchestration Engine, Analysis Pipeline, and Insight Delivery System, making advanced marketing research capabilities accessible to organizations of all sizes.

**SurveyMind**  
**Focus:** Generating synthetic survey respondents with realistic psychological profiles  
**Type:** Simulation framework  
**Key aspects:** Personality-driven simulation, Big Five model, response pattern modeling, survey pretesting  
**Description:** SurveyMind is an open-source framework for generating psychologically realistic synthetic survey respondents to facilitate survey methodology research and questionnaire optimization. Built on the foundation of the Big Five personality model and trained on over 1 million personality inventory responses, the system creates diverse synthetic personas with calibrated personality traits and demographic characteristics that exhibit realistic response patterns across different survey question types. The framework enables researchers to efficiently test questionnaires across a wide range of respondent types without the costs and time constraints of human recruitment, helping identify potential issues in survey design before human deployment.

**Future of Strategy: Pressure testing synthetic research**  
**Description:** Putting peer-reviewed, in-market GenAI synthetic research tools to the test by stacking process, inputs/outputs, insights, and directional strategy against traditional organic methodology.

- A side-by-side comparison of human-to-human research and synthetic research using the same briefs for the research lead and the robots.  
- The test compared a national market research program that combined qualitative and quantitative across 20 geographical markets, three unique audience segments, and a spectrum of demo and psychographic.  
- Interview insights were then run through a stack of GenAI tools to see how they were at crafting strategy and visual identity.
