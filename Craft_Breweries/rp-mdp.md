# Table 0: RP-to-RP Thematic Connection Matrix

 | RP1 | RP2 | RP3 | RP4 | RP5
RP1 | - | ✅ Shared focus on social experience | ✅ Shared goal of retention | ✅ Both increase time-on-site | ✅ AI could promote games/events
RP2 |  | - | ✅ Themed & social events | ✅ Experience-enhancing offerings | ✅ AI could match preferences
RP3 |  |  | - | ✅ Snacks complement events | ✅ AI gauges music preference
RP4 |  |  |  | - | ✅ AI suggests food pairings
RP5 |  |  |  |  | -

# Table 1: How Research Projects Relate to the Main Discussion Point

| Research Project | Primary Focus | Key Findings | Direct Impact on MDP |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **RP1** (Chinonso)<br>Customer Retention & Visit Duration | Increasing time spent at brewery and encouraging return visits | - Social games/competition increases visit duration<br>- Staff engagement in activities enhances social atmosphere<br>- Loyalty programs build return customer base<br>- Business networking creates professional customer segment | - Longer visits typically lead to higher sales per visit<br>- Return customers create reliable revenue stream<br>- Networking events can bring in large groups of new customers |

| **RP3 & RP4**<br>(Music & Food) | Both are complementary offerings that enhance the core beer product | - Special food pairings during music events<br>- Increased visit duration from music leads to more food purchases<br>- Both appeal to sensory experiences (taste and sound) |
| **RP3 & RP5**<br>(Music & AI) | Both represent different approaches to enhancing customer experience | - AI can recommend music events based on customer preferences<br>- AI can collect feedback on music events<br>- AI can suggest beers that pair well with music atmosphere |
| **RP4 & RP5**<br>(Food & AI) | Both focus on complementing the beer selection with additional services | - AI can recommend food pairings for specific beers<br>- Food purchase data can inform AI recommendations<br>- Both help customers navigate options and make decisions |

## Overall Integration
All five research projects offer complementary strategies that can be implemented together for maximum impact on the MDP. The central theme connecting all RPs is enhancing customer experience to drive sales and attract new customers, with each RP approaching this goal through different but compatible mechanisms.
