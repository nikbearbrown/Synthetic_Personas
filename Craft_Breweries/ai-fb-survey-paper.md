## 1. Introduction

The food and beverage industry has traditionally relied on personal interaction as a cornerstone of customer experience. However, the integration of generative artificial intelligence as a digital shopping assistant represents a significant evolution in how F&B establishments engage with their customers before, during, and after their visits. This paper examines how restaurants, cafes, breweries, bars, and similar venues are leveraging AI technologies to enhance customer service, streamline operations, and create new business opportunities.

The F&B sector faces unique challenges that make it particularly suitable for AI-assisted shopping and experience enhancement. These include:

1. **Complex Decision Environments**: Customers often face extensive menus, unfamiliar terminology, and limited information about ingredients, preparation methods, and flavor profiles.

2. **Personalization Challenges**: Individual preferences, dietary restrictions, and taste profiles create demand for personalized recommendations that traditional service models struggle to consistently provide at scale.

3. **Knowledge Asymmetry**: Staff knowledge can vary significantly, creating inconsistent customer experiences, particularly in establishments with specialized offerings like craft breweries or fine dining restaurants.

4. **Operational Pressures**: Labor shortages and cost pressures have created demand for technologies that can enhance service efficiency without compromising experience quality.

Unlike traditional digital tools in hospitality that focused primarily on operational efficiency (point-of-sale systems, reservation platforms), generative AI is uniquely positioned to address these challenges through its ability to provide conversational, contextual, and personalized assistance at scale. Acting as a digital shopping assistant, these AI systems can handle pre-visit research, make personalized recommendations, educate customers about offerings, facilitate ordering, and enhance the overall customer journey in ways that complement human service staff.

This survey seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of this emerging trend by synthesizing data from multiple industry sources, exploring impact across different F&B segments, and identifying patterns that may predict future developments in this rapidly evolving space.

Five key patterns emerge from this comprehensive analysis:

1. **Journey Transformation**: AI shopping assistants are fundamentally changing how customers discover, evaluate, and engage with F&B establishments, creating more informed, purposeful, and satisfying experiences.

2. **Business Model Evolution**: Beyond operational efficiency, AI is enabling new value propositions centered on knowledge, personalization, and experience orchestration.

3. **Complementary Service**: Rather than replacing human service, successful AI implementations enhance and complement staff capabilities, allowing more focused attention on high-value interactions.

4. **Segment-Specific Adaptations**: Different F&B segments are leveraging AI in distinctive ways aligned with their core value propositions, from educational depth in breweries to operational efficiency in casual dining.

5. **Continuous Evolution**: The rapidly narrowing conversion gap for AI-referred traffic suggests growing consumer comfort with AI-guided F&B experiences, pointing toward accelerating adoption in coming years.

Particularly noteworthy is how AI shopping assistants are helping F&B establishments address their most persistent challenges: knowledge asymmetry, personalization at scale, operational pressures, and complex decision environments. By providing conversational, contextual, and personalized assistance, these systems are enabling venues to deliver more consistent, satisfying experiences while gathering unprecedented insights about customer preferences.

While there are clear benefits to AI implementation, F&B venues must carefully weigh several important tradeoffs. The control over recommendations and brand narrative offered by custom AI solutions addresses the significant concern that generic AI platforms may favor competitors or misrepresent specialty offerings. However, this control comes at a substantial cost—both financially and in terms of ongoing maintenance requirements. The decision framework proposed by Aquatic Brewery (2025) offers a structured approach to determining implementation urgency based on customer adoption patterns, competitive landscape, and projected ROI timeline.

For specialty establishments like craft breweries with diverse, complex offerings that are often misunderstood by generic AI platforms, the investment may be justified sooner rather than later. For more standardized F&B operations, a more measured approach may be warranted. In either case, a phased implementation strategy often provides the best balance between innovation and risk management.

The strong ROI metrics, with payback periods as short as 5-6 months for some implementations, suggest that economic incentives will continue to drive adoption even as the technology matures. As implementation barriers decrease and customer expectations evolve, F&B establishments that effectively balance technological capabilities with authentic human connection are likely to gain significant competitive advantage in this rapidly changing landscape.
